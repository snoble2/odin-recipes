        <h3>The ultimate comfort recipe</h3>
        <p>What makes this dish so delicious? It could be the mixture of two types of ground meat&mdash;beef and Italian sausage&mdash;that gives it so much flavor. It could be the addition of sugar to the acidic, tomato-based sauce, which mellows it out and gives it just the right hint of sweetness. It could also have something to do with the three kinds of cheese thrown in: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta. Or maybe, this lasagna is so good because it's always been made with lots of love.</p>
        <p>This is a recipe I reach for time and time again, both to fill bellies and warm hearts. There's much I'm uncertain about in life, but something I know for sure is that I have the best lasagna recipe to share with the people I love, and lots of memories of a life lived.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pound Italian sausage, casing removed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chopped onions</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>16 ounces canned tomato paste</li>
            <li>15 ounces canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried sweet basil</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, halved</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3/4 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound lasagna noodles (such as "no-bake" lasagna sheets)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, Italian sausage, onions, and garlic in a deep cooking pan or sauce pot, cook until meat is browned and onions are translucent.</li>
            <li>Drain meat mixture; then add tomato paste, tomato sauce, parsley flakes, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, and sugar to the pan. Stir until well-combined, then let simmer, for at least one hour. (I like to simmer my sauce on the stove for several hours to allow the flavors to combine.)</li>
            <li>When ready to assemble the lasagna, spray a lasagna pan (or 9 X 13 baking dish) with cooking spray and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, ½ cup Parmesan cheese, oregano, and remaining 1 ½ teaspoons of salt until thoroughly mixed.</li>
            <li>Layer lasagna noodles, meat sauce mixture, ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese 2-3 times (depending on how much pasta you prefer in your lasagna), then top with remaining mozzarella cheese and ½ cup of the parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil (I spray the inside of the foil to prevent cheese from sticking to it) and bake at 350 degrees F until cheese is melted and sauce mixture is bubbling, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a crispy cheese topping, switch the oven to broil and remove foil. Broil on high for 3 to 5 minutes, until cheese is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let stand for 15 minutes before serving. Serves 12.</li>
        </ol>
