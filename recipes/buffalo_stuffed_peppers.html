        <h3><em>Delicious weeknight meal</em></h3>
        <p>You need just five ingredients to bring this meal to life: Shredded rotisserie chicken (or leftover if you made roast chicken yourself), bell peppers of any color you like, crumbled blue cheese (I love Maytag), plain Greek yogurt, and Buffalo sauce.</p>
        <p>This stuffed pepper recipe serves two to four people, depending on your appetite. To round out the meal and really drive home the Buffalo wing vibes, I often add a side of carrot and celery sticks.</p>
