        <h3>Delicious weeknight meal</h3>
        <p>You need just five ingredients to bring this meal to life: Shredded rotisserie chicken (or leftover if you made roast chicken yourself), bell peppers of any color you like, crumbled blue cheese (I love Maytag), plain Greek yogurt, and Buffalo sauce.</p>
        <p>This stuffed pepper recipe serves two to four people, depending on your appetite. To round out the meal and really drive home the Buffalo wing vibes, I often add a side of carrot and celery sticks.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1/3 cup Buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>2 bell peppers, halved, stems and seeds removed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese</li>
            <li>Optional: Carrot and celery sticks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, toss chicken with buffalo sauce and Greek yogurt until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Evenly distribute the chicken mixture among the bell pepper halves.</li>
            <li>Coat a medium baking dish with cooking spray, then add the stuffed peppers. Pour in Â¼-inch water to allow the peppers to steam.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and bake, uncovered, for about 30 minutes or until the peppers are tender and the filling is warm throughout.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, top with blue cheese, and enjoy with carrot and celery sticks on the side, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
